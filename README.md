# Rheem-QuDS
This project supports Querying Data Sources (QuDS) existing in multiple platforms. QuDS is developed as an application on top of Rheem. 
Examples of operations/queries supported by QuDS are: 
1- Evaluating and Ranking Join Paths, 
2- Get context-based sample of a table, i.e, the sampling based on given keywords from the user,
3- Ranking tables matching a given keyword,
4- Joining tables stored in different platforms/format, e.g., postgress tables, csv files, data in HDFS storage,
5- Tuning the accracy of each operation to meet a time budget set by the user/application. 

Rheem is utilized to handel and optimize the cross-platform challenges.
